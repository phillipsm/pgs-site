                Fundamental to <a href="/" class="highlight-inline-landing">Public Good Studio</a>, is the idea that we have the ability to shape the world around us. We can and should make tools that improve our lives.

        <div class="about-desc">
            <p class="body-text">Hello</p>
            <p>My name is Matthew Phillips and I founded Public Good Studio in 2017. PGS exists to make forward looking products for public good organizations. Especially libraries.</p>
            <p>We keep our studio and our efforts sustainable by only producing goods that are marketable broadly.</p>
            <p>The first in a series of many PGS products is <a href="https://OpenBooth.store" target="_blank">OpenBooth</a>. OpenBooth is a phone booth that offers maximum transparency and accessibility. It adds privacy and mental focus to libraries, lobbies, open offices, and similar working environments.
            <p>The work I do at PGS has been greatly shaped by my previous professional position in the <a href="https://lil.law.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>. I spent seven years in the Lab and learned a tremendous amount about shaping the technical, organizational and creative dimensions of tools in the library and internet spaces.</p>
            <p>I hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Mansfield University of Pennsylvania and a M.S. in Computer Science from Virginia Tech.</p>
            <p>Bicycles, booths, computers, horseplay, style and libraries consume most of my time.</p>
            <p>As I write this in early 2020, PGS is focused on OpenBooth - manufacturing and selling. Though, we're always up for a fun collaboration, <a href="/contact">let's connect!</a></p>
            <p>Thank you for reading.</p>
            <p>Matt Phillips</p>
