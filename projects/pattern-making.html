            <p class="desc-title">About</p>
            <p>
                Drawing with algorithms is powerful - setup the guardrails and let the machine run. It doesn't grow weary.
            </p>
            <p>
                These two samples are drawn using JavaScript and the p5.js graphics library.

            <p class="desc-title">Why</p>
            <p>
                Applications are broad. Patterns can be beautiful in print, and are a natural fit serving as backgrounds, screen art and information rich display systems.
