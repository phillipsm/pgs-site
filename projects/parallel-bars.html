            <p class="desc-title">About</p>
            <p>
                We're currently reseraching, designing and building parallel bars to support wellness in the library and in the workplace.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">Why</p>
            <p>
                Let's encourage stretching, light gymnastics and calesthinics through new pieces of exercise equipment - equipment made from durable, renewable, elegant materials.
            </p>
