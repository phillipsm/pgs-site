        <p>Drawing with algorithms is powerful - setup the guardrails and let the machine run. It doesn't grow weary.</p>
        <p>Applications are broad. Patterns can be beautiful in print, and are a natural fit serving as backgrounds, screen art and information rich display systems.</p>
        <p>These three samples are drawn using JavaScript and the p5.js graphics library.</p>

        <p>OpenBooth is a piece of occupiable furniture - a booth for making audio and video calls. It provides privacy and a place of focus without modifying your buildingâ€™s infrastructure.</p>
        <p>Common applications include offices with open floorplans, coffee shops, libraries, study lounges, hotel lobbies, waiting areas, coworking spaces and airports.</p>
