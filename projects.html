        <p>Drawing with algorithms is powerful - setup the guardrails and let the machine run. It doesn't grow weary.</p>
        <p>Applications are broad. Patterns can be beautiful in print, and are a natural fit serving as backgrounds, screen art and information rich display systems.</p>
        <p>These three samples are drawn using JavaScript and the p5.js graphics library.</p>
