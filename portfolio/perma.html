            This feature was implemented in 2017 in the Harvard Library Innovation Lab in Cambridge, MA.

            Perma.cc is a web service that helps scholars, journals, courts, and others create permanent records of the web sources they cite.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma is used by more than half of the law schools in the US, has been used by a US President and the Supreme Court.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma's core service is simple - input a URL and receive an archive in return.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your archive is stored at your library and is available forever. No more 404s or shifting content.

    </div>

    <div class="problem-text">
        <p>
            Presenting an archive of a webpage can be confusing. The biggest concern centers around the URL in your browser's address bar. Under normal use, you'll see a Perma.cc URL in your address bar but the conent of the browsers will be from another site, say Wikipedia..
        </p>
        <p>
            Keeping user confusion low is a signficiant challenge - we must clearly label the archive so the user knows they're viewing a backup and not the site of the original publisher.
        </p>
        <p>
            We need to avoid user confusion and also avoid being a host for content that is normally stored behind a paywall. We don't want to steal views from creators while trying to keep content stable as the internet shifts below.

    <div class="solution-text">
        <p>
            Presenting an archive of a webpage generates a number of competing concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            The user that followed the link to the web archive wants to see the archived webpage - they're after the original content.
        </p>
        <p>
            Perma needed to clearly let the user know that they were viewing an archive at perma.cc/some-guid even if the contents clearly originated elsewhere.
            Perma could be used as tool to avoid paywalls and direct traffic to the original content provider.

            The interface needed to offer a lot and still stay out of the users way.

            Overview of the design process

            We'll dig into each step below. The high level is about same process I use for most larger interaction design efforts.

        <p>
            Gather two to a few people around a table and set a timer for 3 minutes. Each person fills out as many wild ideas as possible on a stack of index cards.

            Very little filter. Almost all bad ideas.

            Repeat step one until it feels tired. Three or four rounds of tow or three cards per round is a good mark to hit.

            Cull those ideas down to a handful. In the group, synthesize and flesh out.

            Make lo-fi sketches that can be tossed around internally. These should be pencil and paper or balsamiq wireframes that do nothing more than present the new interaction.

            If an idea feels potentially promising, up the fidelity just a little bit with a balsamiq or  InVision

            Canvas power users, coworkers, test partners and friends to play with sketches.

            This step not only refines and stress tests potential directions, it gets the team on the same page. It clarifies. It provides focus on the best path forward.

            Friendly users see an InVision style mockup. If that's touch, they see the feature branch that's been built out by the engineers.

            Take lessons learn. Iterate on any deal breakers and roll out the feature. Build support docs and help the communications team get the word out.

            I led the Interaction Design effort on the featured described in this case study, and across Perma generally. I also functioned as a full stack developer by contirbuting Python and JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked within a team of seven people on Perma.cc - one project manager, one UI designer, one communications person and three full stack developers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our team was led by the brilliant Harvard faculty member, Jonathan Zittrain. He initiated the effort, found funding and guided the vision for this web archiving service.
