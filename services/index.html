        <p>Drawing with algorithms is powerful - setup the guardrails and let the machine run. It doesn't grow weary.</p>
        <p>Applications are broad. Patterns can be beautiful in print, and are a natural fit serving as backgrounds, screen art and information rich display systems.</p>
        <p>These three samples are drawn using JavaScript and the p5.js graphics library.</p>

        <p>A CNC router allows us to run a lean and capable shop. It has a large format table that can precisely mill sheets of wood and plastic as large as 8 feet wide by 14 feet long.</p>
        <p>It lived in a sign shop before we repurposed it for <a href="https://OpenBooth.store" target="_blank">OpenBooth</a> production.</p>
        <p>We can help you create CAD/CAM designs, or you can supply your own. </p>
