            <p class="desc-title">Why it's good</p>
            <p>
                A screen capture that isn't in a frame forces the viewer to contextualize it. That forced contextualization takes away from your content and blunts the focus of the viewer.
            <p>
                These frames provide a focal point. They're plain and they're friendly. Their aim is to stay out of the way while highlighting your screen captures.
