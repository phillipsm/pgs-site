            <p>
                thelibrary.fm is a site that houses sound recordings of libraries. It helps you hop into a library, aurally, from anywhere on the Web.
            </p>
            <p>
                thelibrary.fm illustrates that the library is not a single thing. It's not a single experience. The sound in a library can range from vibrant and playful if you're in a children's room or quiet and weighty if you're in a reading room.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">Noise can be good</p>
            <p>
                A bit of ambient noise can push thinking in positive ways. If your environment is too quiet, it's possible to become too focused and end up trapped in a silence bubble. <a href="http://nyti.ms/1cWsWvZ" target="_blank">The right type of sounds at the right volume can be helpful</a>.

            <p class="desc-title">Collaboration</p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://buildingways.com/" target="_blank">Jeff Goldenson</a> and I built the thelibrary.fm together in the <a href="http://librarylab.law.harvard.edu" target="_blank">Harvard Library Innovation Lab</a>.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">Off into the sunset</p>
            <p>
                Building thelibrary.fm was fun and encouraged critial listening in the libtar, but in 2016 we decided to turn power it down to free up energy for other projects.
