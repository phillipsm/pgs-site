            <p>
                OpenBooth is a piece of occupiable furniture - a booth for making audio and video calls. It provides privacy and a place of focus without modifying your buildingâ€™s infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                Common applications include offices with open floorplans, coffee shops, libraries, study lounges, hotel lobbies, waiting areas, coworking spaces and airports.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">Why</p>
            <p>
                Open working environments overexpose us. Too many sounds. Too many distractions. They force us to multi-task and keep us from being our best selves.
            </p>
            <p>
                When we increase our privacy, our focus improves, and we are able to perform at significantly higher levels. We become more creative, our cognitive abilities sharpen, our stress levels decrease, our sick days drop, and we add 15% to the bottom line. The benefits of working in a focused space are clear and long established.
