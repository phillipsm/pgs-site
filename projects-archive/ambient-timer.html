            <p>a low-stress visual timer with a simple input mechanism for setting the countdown</p>
            <p class="desc-title">About</p>
            <p>There are occasions when you need a timer but find that a ticking stopwatch is too stressful. Ambient Timer provides a countdown mechanism without the stress. Set it, glance at it, when the screen is green, time's up.</p>
            <p>
                One of the virtues of the Ambient Timer is its simplicity. There are no buttons or text fields - all control happens through the URL. If you want to start a timer for 1 minute and 20 seconds, you visit example.com/1m20s. If you want a timer for 2 hours, 20 minutes, and 17 seconds you visit example.com/2h20m17s.
            </p>

                Ambient Timer is a simple web application. It leverages SVG to draw a grill across the screen and uses an SVG Animation to move a large SVG Rectangle from the top left of the screen to the bottom right.
