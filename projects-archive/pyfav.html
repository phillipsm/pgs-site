            <p>
                Favicons are the small icons that show up in a web browser's tab when you navigate to a page.
            </p>
            <p>
                They can be annoying to programmatically retrieve because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon#Browser_implementation" target="_blank">they’re commonly located in a handful of different places</a>. pyfav is a Python library that removes the annoyance by handling the details for you – you supply a URL and pyfav will give you the favicon.
            </p>
            <p class="desc-title">What's so great about a favicon?</p>
            <p>
                Favicons are fascinating because of the tight constraint they enforce. They ask an organization to represent their identity in one 16 pixel by 16 pixel image.</p>
            <p>
                This constraint surfaces things about the organization. Do they value their logo over a more abstract representation? Maybe the first letter of their organization's name is most important. What colors do they use to represent themselves? This scarcity of space can be revealing.
